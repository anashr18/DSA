ðŸ§  Why Two-Pointer is Preferred in Interviews:
O(n) time and O(1) space (no extra string storage).

Good example of pointer manipulation and condition handling.

Allows interviewers to assess your loop condition design, edge case reasoning, and code clarity.

ðŸš© Interview Tips:
Be ready to explain why you're using isalnum() and .lower().

Also prepare for follow-ups:

What if it's a linked list instead of string?

What if itâ€™s a stream of characters?
